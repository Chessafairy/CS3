			 <h1>Axolotl morphs</h1>
			 <p>Leucistic Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that have translucent white skin, crimson or pink gills,
			 and dark brown or black eyes together with dazzling gold specks. They are one of the most prevalent
			 and attractive variants in captivity, but they are quite rare in the wild since predators can easily recognize them.</p>
			 
			 <p>Wild type Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that have mottling that is dark grayish green and black. They also have a pale belly
			 and iridophores that have gold flecks in them. They have the same hues and patterns as wild species do. he pet industry has used this 
			 shade the longest, and it is the standard. In 1863, the first species of the wild were brought to Europe.</p>
			 
			 <p>Piebald Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that have black eyes, dark green, gray, or black symmetrical patches on their face and back 
			 and they also have white bodies with red gills. These markings can occasionally extend down their sides and legs, but this is 
			 uncommon. This design mostly only appears on the top part of the body. The majority of breeders are in New Zealand, and the piebald
			 gene is heritable but extremely uncommon. As the axolotl ages, this pattern darkens and may eventually result in a black and white salamander.</p>
			 
			 <h1>Axolotls</h1>
			 
			 <p>Mosaic Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that have black, white, and golden flecks. Additionally, they could have multicolored
			 eyes and gills with red and purple stripes.  The majority of mosaics have both melanistic and albino parents. They are the product 
			 of the union of two eggs. Each cell doesn't exhibit colors from either parent evenly; instead, it does so in a random manner.
			 This leads to an exquisite and distinctive axolotl color. Mosaics are unintended outcomes that cannot be bred for.</p>
			 
			 <p>Chimera Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that is so unique that it is debatable whether or not it belongs in the category of real morphs.
			 Chimeras exhibit two morphs on either side of their bodies, one on each side. It is divided into left and right sections directly down the middle. 
			 Half albino and half wild-type make up the few chimeras that have born. Only when two maturing eggs fuse together to form one do chimera axolotls
			 appear. Due to incomplete egg fusion, the majority of eggs do not hatch. Chimeras cannot be selectively bred since they are a developmental 
			 incident and not a hereditary condition.</p>
