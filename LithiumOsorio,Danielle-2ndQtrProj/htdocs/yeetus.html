					<h2 id="bald">Piebalds</h2>
					<p>Piebald Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that have black eyes, dark green, gray, or black symmetrical patches on their face and back 
		and they also have white bodies with red gills. These markings can occasionally extend down their sides and legs, but this is 
		uncommon. This design mostly only appears on the top part of the body. The majority of breeders are in New Zealand, and the piebald
		gene is heritable but extremely uncommon. As the axolotl ages, this pattern darkens and may eventually result in a black and white salamander.</p>

					<h2 id="mosaicis">Mosaic Axolotls</h2>
					<p>Mosaic Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that have black, white, and golden flecks. Additionally, they could have multicolored
			eyes and gills with red and purple stripes.  The majority of mosaics have both melanistic and albino parents. They are the product 
			of the union of two eggs. Each cell doesn't exhibit colors from either parent evenly; instead, it does so in a random manner.
			This leads to an exquisite and distinctive axolotl color. Mosaics are unintended outcomes that cannot be bred for.</p>
