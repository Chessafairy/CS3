					<h2 id="chimers">Chimera Axolotls</h2>
					<p>Chimera Axolotls are a variant of axolotls that is so unique that it is debatable whether or not it belongs in the category of real morphs.
			Chimeras exhibit two morphs on either side of their bodies, one on each side. It is divided into left and right sections directly down the middle. 
			Half albino and half wild-type make up the few chimeras that have born. Only when two maturing eggs fuse together to form one do chimera axolotls
			appear. Chimeras cannot be selectively bred since they are a developmental 
			incident and not a hereditary condition.</p>

					<p>The black melanoids have a black or dark body and a light-colored belly. They do not have a bright ring around the pupil of an eye,
					and they do not have bright patches (iridophores) anywhere on their body. In cases, dark and wild type of axolotl
					is recognized as a black melanoid</p>
