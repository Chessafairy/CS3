					<h2 id="specklers">Speckled Leucistic Axolotls</h2>
					<p>Speckled leucistic axolotls are a type of leucistic mutation. They have dark green, brown, or black speckles on their
					heads, tails, and back. Like normal leucistic morphs, their base color is white, and the amount of speckling is not as
					extreme as it is in the piebald or mosaic morphs. This axolotl often starts out looking identical to a leucistic and develops
					speckling later in life. As they grow their pigment cells mature too, allowing their coloration and freckle pattern to change.</p>
